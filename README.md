🏠 New York Housing Price Prediction
Objective: Built a machine learning pipeline to predict housing prices in New York City using structured real estate data.

🔧 Key Contributions:
Collected and cleaned real estate datasets containing broker titles, property types, prices, square footage, and geolocation data (latitude/longitude).

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify feature correlations using heatmaps and visual insights.

Trained and evaluated Linear Regression and Logistic Regression models to analyze numerical and categorical feature impacts on price.

Performed feature engineering to convert and combine relevant address and location components (e.g., locality, sublocality, administrative areas).

Compared model performance using evaluation metrics (e.g., R², accuracy), identifying which algorithm was better suited for prediction.

Documented project limitations, including narrow geographic focus and potential noise from irrelevant features.

Proposed future improvements such as including more diverse datasets and automated feature selection.

🛠 Tech Stack:
Languages: Python

Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Excel (optional for initial EDA), PowerPoint (for presentation)

📈 Result:
Delivered a predictive model and insights into housing price influencers within NYC.

Demonstrated ability to manage real-world datasets, apply supervised learning techniques, and communicate results effectively.
